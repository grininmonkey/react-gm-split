[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-gm-split.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-gm-split) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

> Work in Progress, I am copying my personal split component I have used within my CRA-Templates for some time and making "Yet Another" public split component... because, why not ;-)

## Install

```bash
Work In Progress: Not Ready Yet...
```

## Or

Download the raw src/index.js file from this repo and save it within your existing project (rename and/or modify it) and then import it... 
```jsx
import Split from '<path to saved file>'
```

## Usage

```jsx
import Split from 'react-gm-split'
...

export default function MyComponent(props) {
  return(
    <Split>
      <MyLeftComponent>
      <MyRightComponent>
    <Split>
  )
}
```
or (as a concept example)

```jsx
return(
    <Split>
      {someVarA === 1 && <SomeComponentA>}
      {someVarA === 2 && <SomeComponentB>}
      {someVarB === 1 && <SomeComponentC>}
      {someVarB === 2 && <SomeComponentD>}
    <Split>
)
```
The `Split` component will setup a split when there are only 2 objects within the children array that are not `null` or `false`. So there can be `null` or `false` items as a result of a map or direct conditions like above and will be
ignored when checking for render items.

When there are only 1, or more than 2 render items, `Split` will return those items but not setup as a "split" layout with a gutter and will esentially just be a wrapping `<div>`. In this senerio/condition, the `style` property passed to `Split` will be applied to the parent wrapper. When doing a split the `style` property is ignored and `initialParentStyle` property is applied.

## Properties
- `id: string | number`
- `as: string 'Columns' | 'Rows'`
- `passProps: bool` 
- `gutterSize: string | number`
- `gutterStyle: style object`
- `gutterRender: react component`
- `primaryIndex: number`
- `collapsedSize: string | number`
- `primaryMinSize: string | number`
- `primaryMaxSize: string | number`
- `gutterClassName: string`
- `initialPrimarySize: string | number`
- `initialParentStyle: style object`
- `primaryInitialState: bool`
- `secondaryInitialState: bool`
- `collapsedInitialState: bool`

### `Size` related properties

The component works by calculating and setting percentage for Left|Right or Top|Bottom `gridTemplate`
css property.

`gutterSize` is treated as pixels.

The primary `Size` related properties are treated as pixels unless the value passed is a string that contains `%`.

### passProps

When set to `{true}` an additional object named `splitProps` is passed to the children of `Split` which contains the state props and some additional methods of the `Split` container. 

- `dispatch( string )`
  - collapse
  - restore
  - hidePrimary
  - hideSecondary
- `isCollapsed`
- `isPrimaryHidden`
- `isSecondaryHidden`
- `getSessionData()`
- `getParentClientRect()`
- `getGridTemplateStyle()`

## Key Behaviors

- If the children count is something other than 2 it simply returns/renders the children directly without wrapping the children as a `split`.
- Has collapse primary and hide parent/secondary actions that can be envoked from the child elements using a passed dispatch method. `passProps` must be set to `{true}`
- Parent wrapping element does not trigger state when resizing... allowing for resizing and actions to not envoke children during those activites.
- Children can reference and get parent dems and properties via the passed `splitProps` properties. `passProps` must be set to `{true}`
- Can specify which child component is treated as the primary using the `primaryIndex` property.

## Notes
- Make sure the CSS properties that allow this element to take full space are applied. Meaning... if you do not have flex,grid or basic 100% width/height applied to the path of the component you use this in... it may not look correctly.
- The children must have CSS `overflow` set and have a `background-color` set or the natural grid behavior(s) will either prevent the shrinking or when using the hide actions the contents will be visible underneath the full sized column/row.
- Once rendered, props are not tested for changes, meaning any state changes within the calling component that are used for any of the `Split` properties will not have an impact unless its a change to the children. I needed this behavior for my projects from which I extracted component from...
- Uses sessionStorage to keep restore snapshots etc.. which relies on the `id` property to be unique. One is assigned by default, but if you manually pass one.. make sure it's unique within the scope of rendered `Splits` at one time. If your page conent changes and the `Split` component is unmounted and then changed back to render the same `Split` component... the last position and state (collapsed or hidden etc...) will remain if the same `id` is applied.
